MATH480-final-project
=====================
On this final project I plan to investigate the following problem:
Problem(range of rational reconstruction)
Given positive integer m > 2 , how many elements in the set Z/mZ
can be written as n/d, with n,|d| <= sqrt(m/2)?
Goal: Give an asymptotic formula as m -> infty

As an alternative, I may investigate this challenge problem:
given a binary integer a, define an operation to be: 
add a any number of + signs between any two digits of a, and compute the sum.
It's clear given any number, finitely many operations will change this number a to 1.
Now the question is: How many operations do you need at most?
An example:
a = 100111011 -> 100+1+1+10+11 = 1011 -> 10+1+1 = 100 -> 1+0+0 = 1
Goal: give an absolute constant C, such that for any number a, there exists
a sequence of at most C operations, changing a to 1.
