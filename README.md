MATH480-final-project
=====================
On this final project I plan to investigate the following problem:
Problem(range of rational reconstruction)
Given positive integer m > 2 , how many elements in the set Z/mZ
can be written as n/d, with n,|d| <= sqrt(m/2)?
Goal: Give an asymptotic formula as m -> infty
